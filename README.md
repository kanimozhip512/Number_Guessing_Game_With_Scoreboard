****# Python Number Guessing Game with Scoreboard****

A Python mini-project that lets you play a Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ². The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 50, and you have 10 attempts to guess it correctly.

This project demonstrates core Python concepts like **variables, conditionals, loops, functions, random number generation, math operations, and lists** in a fun way.

**## ðŸš€ Features**
- Random number generation using `random.randint()`  
- Tracks scores across multiple rounds ðŸ“Š  
- Displays **best score** and **average score**  
- Uses functions for modular code design  
- Interactive CLI (Command Line Interface) game
